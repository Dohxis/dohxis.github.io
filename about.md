Hello, my name is Domantas, also know as Dohxis. I am indie game developer, technology enthusiast and Linux fanboy!
This is my personal blog and portfolio.

### Projects
[c2Rail](https://github.com/Dohxis/c2Rail) - Simple PHP content management system created with Silex.

### Jams
[Coinarium](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=41073) - My first ever project for Ludum Dare. Itâ€™s a game where you need to collect coins and avoid enemies. It was made in 28 hours with Haxe and HaxeFlixel.
