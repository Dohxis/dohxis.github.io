Hello, my name is Domantas, also know as Dohxis. I am indie game developer, technology enthusiast and Linux fanboy! Most comfortable with `PHP` and `Haxe` programming languages, but
I have a good knowledge of languages like `Javascript`, `Python`, `Java` and `D`.  This is my personal blog and portfolio.

### Projects
[Portum](https://#) - is my long-term project. It's a complex strategy, social game in your browser. Built with `PHP` and `Laravel` framework. I am planning to make it open-source!

### Jams
[Coinarium](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=41073) - My first ever project for Ludum Dare 31. It’s a game where you need to collect coins and avoid enemies. It was made in 28 hours with `Haxe` and `HaxeFlixel`.
[Boxmagedon](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=41073) - My second game for Ludum Dare 32. It’s is a game where you need to destroy other boxes and collect batteries. It was made with `Javascript` and `Phaser`.
[Monstrada](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=41073) - My third game for Ludum Dare 33. Kill enemies and survive as long as possible. Game was made in pretty short time with `Javascript` and `Phaser`.
